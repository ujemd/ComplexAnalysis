# ComplexAnalysis

A repository for tinkering with complex numbers, starting with a way of visualising the filled-in Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.

Any comment, suggestion or question is welcomed and appreciated!

I'll be updating and editing this readme file, as well as adding new functions to the project.
